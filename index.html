        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            I am a young tech enthusiast from Muranga County. <br>
            I have had a passion for computers since I was introduced to them in hoghschool.<br>
            I was specifically intrigued by the way you could write a program (a set of intructions) and the computer would do exactly that.<br>
            Since then I have aways wanted t write my own software that could change the world.
